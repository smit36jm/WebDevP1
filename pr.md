1. What did you like about this website?
I love the black and light blue on the home page! The little snowboarder that goes back and forth is pretty awesome too!
2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
One difference that I saw is our background image. I also used background images, but you repeat yours and I had mine cover the entire screen.
    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    I think my website might have a better user experience just because your website can be hard to read on some pages.
    2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    Our codebases can both be easily maintained since we both use a shared CSS file.
3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
For the most part but there are a couple suggestions I would make.
    1. if not, suggest some specific improvements
    I think you might want to consider making more than one CSS file. This allows you to customize your site more and not have
    the same images on every page!
4.  Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
I would try to use a better font size and color on your downhill speeder page. The black on the background makes it very hard to read.
I also might consider adding a little more content instead of just having pictures and GIFs. Lastly, I think you are supposed to have 5 pages
not including the report. I donâ€™t believe you are supposed to include the report on your site so I might add another page and take the report off.
    1. were semantically appropriate elements selected
    Yes! Your formatting looks great your code is very easy to read and is clean. Also, your variable and class names are simple and accurate.
    2. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    You have all of your CSS in one file so I would say yes it would say it limits duplication since you have no other CSS files.
5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
Like I said above, just add some more content and make the text a little more readable but other than that it looks good.
