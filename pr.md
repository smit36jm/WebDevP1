Q1. What did you like about this website?

A1. I like the fact that this website contains a lot of images throughout the pages. 
    I also like the fact that the website styling is consistent throughout all the pages of the website.
    The navigation bar is also makes it easy to navigate through the website.
    
Q2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g. Which has a better user experience (and why)? Which codebase do 
you think would be more maintainable (and why)?

A2. There are many difference between my website and this website. I felt that my website looked a lot cleaner based on how the text was presented on each page.
    This website makes it hard for the user to read text as the text and background colors don't differ much. I also felt that it's hard to understand what the purpose
    of each page is, for example there are pages like "downhill speedster" and "Park Antics" which serve no real purpose. The text is not alligned correctly, the picture description
    is very difficult to read as well. My website offers a better user experience, every page of my website serves a specific purpose. I also think that the light background
    i've chosen in my background make it really easy to see the text throughout the website. Unlike my website this website does not contain many buttons which I think
    should be added to give this website a better aesthetic. I believe that my website was more maintainable overall, When looking at the code of this website I found
    that there was no main file being shared throughout each page. Since this file is missing there is a lot code duplication, such as duplicating code for the navigation bar
    in each page. This is one of the reasons I believe the code in my website would be easier to maintain.


Q3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?

A3. I believe that the code of this website is not very well structured. All the code is inside the <body> tags and it is not being seperated into different <divs>
    to make it look more structured. I would suggest seperating code in a way that makes it easier to see what each part of the file is doing.
  
 Q4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them. were semantically appropriate elements selected? is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
 
 A4. I did not find any other issues, Semantically appropriate elements were selected mostly. The CSS does not contain duplication.
  
 Q5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
  
 A5. I would tell the author to spend more time on creating the website. I felt like it was a rushed project.
